This is my own portfolio website built in Angular, Bootstrap and a bunch of other plugins. Visit the live website at https://gsabales.me

## Plug-ins/Libraries
Special thanks to the ff:
* Layout and CSS properties: https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/
* On-scroll animation: https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ 
* CSS animation: Just plain-old keyframes lol :D 
* Modal: https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/modal/examples
* Email: https://www.smtpjs.com/ & https://elasticemail.com/ (This is temporary. Will create a backend service for this portfolio later on)

## Deployment
I built this Angular app by running the command <b>ng build --aot --prod --output-hashing=none</b> since the hash in compiled js files are not accepted in Firebase. Speaking of which, I use <b>Firebase</b> for web hosting and I bought the domain from <b>Namecheap</b> (hoping for sponsorship lol).
